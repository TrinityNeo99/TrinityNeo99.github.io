S. Eliot, a man fascinated by the “presence” of the past, wrote the most innovative poetry of his time. ❸The lesson for today’s literary community seems obvious: a reorientation toward tradition would benefit writers no less than readers. ❹But if our writers and critics indeed respect the novel’s rich tradition (as they claim to), then why do they disdain the urge to tell an exciting story? 题目 The author of the passage suggests that present-day readers would particularly benefit from which of the following changes on the part of present-day writers and critics?A. An increased focus on the importance of engaging the audience in a narrativeB. Modernization of the traditional novelistic elements already familiar to readersC. Embracing aspects of fiction that are generally peripheral to the interest of readersD. A greater recognition of how the tradition of the novel has changed over timeE. A better understanding of how certain poets such as Eliot have influenced fiction of the present time 选 A 文章的最后一句话，如果当今读者确实尊重传统的话，那么为什么他们鄙视写故事呢？ 写故事-&gt; 文学创作中的遵守传统 看了张禄老师的解读，觉得这个 A中的narrative 的替换还是很牵强的 (明天在想，先睡一觉) Passage 80文章Passage 80 ❶Historian Colin Calloway argues that in the late colonial period preceding the American Revolution (1775-1783), the British government sought to seal off territory west of the Appalachian Mountain from the encroachment of land-hungry White settlers, to negotiate with Native American peoples as independent foreign states, and to guarantee the integrity of traditional native American hunting grounds. ❷By contrast, White Americans, released by the out break of the Revolution from the constraints of Britain’s allegedly benevolent policies, are portrayed by Calloway as ruthless land-grabbers whose new national government endorsed their rapacity. ❸Bernard Bailyn argues, however, that the “Americans” who encroached on Native American land during the Revolution had been British only a few years before. ❹When, during and after the Revolution, White Americans seized Native American land by any available means, they were continuing a tradition dating back to the earliest years of English settlement in North America. ❺And, according to Bailyn, the British government’s prewar efforts to preserve the trans-Appalachian west for Native Americans resulted not from humanitarian virtue or ethnic tolerance but from British Merchants’ desire to maintain their lucrative trade with native Americans and the government’ s desire to control immigration and avoid costly conflict between White and Native Americans over land. 要点Seal off 封锁 Britain’s allegedly benevolent policies 英国宣称的 仁慈政府 rapacity 掠夺 Passage 81文章Passage 81 ❶The poet Paul Lawrence Dunbar (1872-1906) was the premier Black writer of poetry that used the dialect of rural African American of the southern United States. ❷Although Dunbar’s works were both popular with readers and acclaimed by literary critics during his lifetime, after the First World War a radical shift occurred, at least in critical opinion of his poetry, and twentieth-century critical evaluation of his work has been generally negative. ❸Some critics attacked his work on social grounds for failing to challenge plantation stereotypes of African Americans. ❹Other critics, such as the post James Weldon Johnson, argued from aesthetic grounds that dialect poetry in general was too limited as an artistic medium, and capable of producing only two effects: pathos and humor. ❺The negative critical trend only began to reverse itself in the 1970s, when scholars began to emphasize the importance of mythic, psychological, and historical dimensions of Dunbar’s works, focusing on the interior and exterior realities of African American life after the Civil War. 要点radical shift 根本性的 Plantation stereotypes of African Americans, AA 对于种植园的成见 Pathos and humor 伤感和幽默 Passage 82文章Passage 82 ❶Analyzing levels of proportional representation of American Indians in state and local government jobs is important for several reasons. ❷First, the basic idea underlying the theory of representative bureaucracy is that the demographic composition of bureaucracy should mirror the demographic composition of the general public. ❸This is because in addition to its symbolic value, increased access to managerial positions may lead to greater responsiveness on the part of policy makers to the policy interests of traditionally disadvantaged groups such as American Indians. ❹Second, the focus on higher-level jobs in bureaucracies(as opposed to nonmanagerial positions) is especially important because managerial positions represent a major source of economic progress for members of traditionally disadvantaged groups, as these jobs confer good salaries, benefits, status, security, and mobility. ❺Third, it is important to know if there has been growth in the American Indian share of more desirable public-sector positions over the last two decades. ❻For instance, Peterson and Duncan argue that the populations and power of American Indians have been growing in certain states. ❼Peterson and Duncan also suggest that this growth may reflect the possibility that American Indian populations are becoming more active in nontraditional areas of politics, assimilating into mainstream culture, and securing with greater frequency leadership positions in nontribal government. 要点assimilate 吸收，同化，融合 ​ assimilating into mainstream culture 融入主流文化 secure with greater frequency leadership positions 获得领导职能（省略） in nontribal government 非部落政府 Representative bureaucracy 代议制政府 managerial position 管理岗位 confer 给予，给 good salaries, benefits, status, security, and mobility 好的收入，回报，地位，保障，和流动性^1 题目 The passage suggests which of the following regarding “access to managerial positions” for disadvantaged groups?A. This access is only significant when the percentage of disadvantaged group members in managerial positions mirrors the percent of that group in the general public.B. This access is largely the result of policy decisions made in response to the interests of those groups.C. This access has meaning apart from any policy benefits it confer on those groups.D. This access often creates increased access to nonmanagerial positions for those groupsE. The extent of this access tends to be similar across different disadvantaged groups 选 C 对应原文： This is because in addition to its symbolic value, increased access to managerial positions may lead to greater responsiveness on the part of policy makers to the policy interests of traditionally disadvantaged groups such as American Indians. 原文句意：这是因为，除了象征性的价值外，增加获得管理职位的机会可能会导致决策者对美国印第安人等传统弱势群体的政策利益作出更大的代表 主干：xxxx lead to responsiveness on makers ​ responsiveness : greater； ​ makers : to (修饰？) 传统弱势群体利益政策制定者 This access has meaning apart from any policy benefits it confer on those groups 选项句意: the access has meaning, apart from any policy benefits, which it confer on those groups 这种access 有（其他）意义，除了balabala Passage 83文章Passage 83 ❶ Pueblo Bonito, the most impressive of the “great houses” at the prehistoric Chaco Canyon site in New Mexico, comprised over 600 rooms and 4 to 5 stories. ❷ Traditional interpretations have viewed the great houses as almost entirely residential with some archaeologists estimating the population of Pueblo Bonito at 1,200. ❸ But Windes recently challenged this view by pointing out the paucity of hearths recorded during the excavation of Pueblo Bonito, which revealed only 3 upper-story hearths, in contrast to 59 ground-floor hearths: habituation rooms would have required hearths for cooking and heat. ❹ It is possible, however, that the collapse of upper-story floors disturbed evidence of upper-story hearth to such an extent that they were not revealed by early excavations such as those conducted by Pepper’s field crews in the 1890s and Judd’s in the 1920s. ❺ Additionally, reliance on room features for early population estimates is complicated by the Chacoan’s later remodeling, especially given Judd’s disinclination to destroy later structures and features to expose earlier ones. ❻ The failure of early excavations to strip off intact floors may have concealed evidence of hearths in upper-story rooms. 要点hearths 炉子 The failure of early excavation to strip off intact floors may concealed evidence of hearths in upper-story room The failure of A to do B, -&gt; A 做 B的失败- &gt; A 未能做 B 翻译：早期挖掘未能剥离出完整的楼层可能隐藏了…. 证据 Additionally, reliance on room features for early population estimates is complicated by the Chacoan’s later remodeling, especially given Judd’s disinclination to destroy later structures and features to expose earlier ones. Chacoan 人之后对Pueblo进行了改造，使得之前的人口估计被禁一步的复杂化，但 Judd 的挖掘不喜欢破坏之后的结构，去探究之前的结构，（接下一句），所以也就没有剥离完整的楼层。 (工科生的脑洞：Chacoan当成一个人，他重新改造了自己的模型，remodeling, 这个模型是估计人口的，加了参数balabal, 然后就边的更复杂了，然后下一句就想不通了。。。。。) 心得看到remodel，我猜大部分理工背景的同学都会想到建模😂 distuibed 是弄乱，理解成了distribute 分发。。。。 Passage 84文章Passage 84 ❶From the 1880s to the 1930s, the textile industry in Japan employed over half of all workers, most of them in the three major branches of silk reeling, cotton spinning, and weaving. ❷Because the branches were highly diverse—in scale, skill requirements, and technology—historians traditionally have analyzed them separately. ❸However, the workforces of all three were drawn primarily from the same population: young, mostly rural women aged 10 to 25. ❹Noting this commonality, Hunter argues that a consideration of the three branches of production together is long overdue: examining elements common to the different branches of textile production may, she asserts, permit the identification of gender-based factors that may have influenced the operation of the Japanese female labor market as a whole. 要点Primarily 主要的 overdue 到期未付的，姗姗来迟的 题目 It can be inferred that Hunter regards which of the following to be a shortcoming of historians’ traditional analyses discussed in the passage?A. Their failure to examine factors common to the three different branches of Japanese textile productionB. Their separation of the Japanese textile industry into three major branches based on differences in scale, skillrequirements, and technologyC. Their failure to acknowledge the contribution made by rural women to the different branches of the textile industry 选 A only 题目要求的是 shortcoming, 不是老观点的内容 Passage 90要点conjunction with 结合。。。。 题目Illustration 详细阐明","link":"/2021/01/12/%E9%98%85%E8%AF%BB170%E5%BF%83%E5%BE%97/"}],"tags":[],"categories":[]}
