<p>❶ MacArthur and Wilson suggested that the biodiversity of an island will vary in direct proportion to a function of the island’s size (i.e., larger islands can support a greater number of species) and in inverse proportion to a function of its distance from the mainland (i.e., many remote islands will tend to support fewer species). ❷ Reduced biodiversity in an island context is likely to require significant adaptation on the part of colonizing human populations. ❸ Evans argues that this limitation makes islands ideal laboratories for the study of human adaptations to the natural environment, whilst Renfrew and Wagstaff, in the introduction to their study of Melos, focus on this limitation in biodiversity as a “significant characteristic of the island ecosystem.” ❹ For human communities, however, this limitation may potentially be offset by other factors. ❺ The reduced biodiversity of an island ecosystem applies only to terrestrial resources: the resources of the sea will be as rich as on any other coastal area, and may be equally important to human communities. ❻ A small island such as Malta or Melos allows all communities direct access to the sea, providing an important nutritional “safety net,” as well as an element of dietary diversity, which may actually give island communities an advantage over their landlocked counterparts. ❼ Islands may also have specific nonbiological resources (such as obsidian on Melos), which may be used in exchange with communities on other islands and adjacent mainlands.</p>

<p>❶In early-twentieth-century England, it was fashionable to claim that only a completely new style of writing could address a world undergoing unprecedented transformation— just as one literary critic recently claimed that only the new “aesthetic of exploratory excess” can address a world undergoing well, you know. ❷Yet in early-twentieth century England, T. S. Eliot, a man fascinated by the “presence” of the past, wrote the most innovative poetry of his time. ❸The lesson for today’s literary community seems obvious: a reorientation toward tradition would benefit writers no less than readers. ❹But if our writers and critics indeed respect the novel’s rich tradition (as they claim to), then why do they disdain the urge to tell an exciting story?</p>

<p>❶Historian Colin Calloway argues that in the late colonial period preceding the American Revolution (1775-1783), the British government sought to seal off territory west of the Appalachian Mountain from the encroachment of land-hungry White settlers, to negotiate with Native American peoples as independent foreign states, and to guarantee the integrity of traditional native American hunting grounds. ❷By contrast, White Americans, released by the out break of the Revolution from the constraints of Britain’s allegedly benevolent policies, are portrayed by Calloway as ruthless land-grabbers whose new national government endorsed their rapacity. ❸Bernard Bailyn argues, however, that the “Americans” who encroached on Native American land during the Revolution had been British only a few years before. ❹When, during and after the Revolution, White Americans seized Native American land by any available means, they were continuing a tradition dating back to <strong>the earliest years of English settlement in North America</strong>. ❺And, according to Bailyn, the British government’s prewar efforts to preserve the trans-Appalachian west for Native Americans resulted not from humanitarian virtue or ethnic tolerance but from British Merchants’ desire to maintain their lucrative trade with native Americans and the government’ s desire to control immigration and avoid costly conflict between White and Native Americans over land.</p>

<p>❶The poet Paul Lawrence Dunbar (1872-1906) was the premier Black writer of poetry that used the dialect of rural African American of the southern United States. ❷Although Dunbar’s works were both popular with readers and acclaimed by literary critics during his lifetime, after the First World War a radical shift occurred, at least in critical opinion of his poetry, and twentieth-century critical evaluation of his work has been generally negative. ❸Some critics attacked his work on social grounds for failing to challenge plantation stereotypes of African Americans. ❹Other critics, such as the post James Weldon Johnson, argued from aesthetic grounds that dialect poetry in general was too limited as an artistic medium, and capable of producing only two effects: pathos and humor. ❺The negative critical trend only began to reverse itself in the 1970s, when scholars began to emphasize the importance of mythic, psychological, and historical dimensions of Dunbar’s works, focusing on the interior and exterior realities of African American life after the Civil War.</p>

<p>❶Analyzing levels of proportional representation of American Indians in state and local government jobs is important for several reasons. ❷First, the basic idea underlying the theory of representative bureaucracy is that the demographic composition of bureaucracy should mirror the demographic composition of the general public. ❸This is because in addition to its symbolic value, increased access to managerial positions may lead to greater responsiveness on the part of policy makers to the policy interests of traditionally disadvantaged groups such as American Indians. ❹Second, the focus on higher-level jobs in bureaucracies(as opposed to nonmanagerial positions) is especially important because managerial positions represent a major source of economic progress for members of traditionally disadvantaged groups, as these jobs confer good salaries, benefits, status, security, and mobility. ❺Third, it is important to know if there has been growth in the American Indian share of more desirable public-sector positions over the last two decades. ❻For instance, Peterson and Duncan argue that the populations and power of American Indians have been growing in certain states. ❼<strong>Peterson and Duncan also suggest that this growth may reflect the possibility that American Indian populations are becoming more active in nontraditional areas of politics, assimilating into mainstream culture, and securing with greater frequency leadership positions in nontribal government.</strong></p>

<p>❶ Pueblo Bonito, the most impressive of the “great houses” at the prehistoric Chaco Canyon site in New Mexico, comprised over 600 rooms and 4 to 5 stories. ❷ Traditional interpretations have viewed the great houses as almost entirely residential with some archaeologists estimating the population of Pueblo Bonito at 1,200. ❸ But Windes recently challenged this view by pointing out the paucity of hearths recorded during the excavation of Pueblo Bonito, which revealed only 3 upper-story hearths, in contrast to 59 ground-floor hearths: habituation rooms would have required hearths for cooking and heat. ❹ It is possible, however, that the collapse of upper-story floors disturbed evidence of upper-story hearth to such an extent that they were not revealed by early excavations such as those conducted by Pepper’s field crews in the 1890s and Judd’s in the 1920s. ❺ Additionally, reliance on room features for early population estimates is complicated by the Chacoan’s later remodeling, especially given Judd’s disinclination to destroy later structures and features to expose earlier ones. ❻ The failure of early excavations to strip off intact floors may have concealed evidence of hearths in upper-story rooms.</p>

<p>❶From the 1880s to the 1930s, the textile industry in Japan employed over half of all workers, most of them in the three major branches of silk reeling, cotton spinning, and weaving. ❷Because the branches were highly diverse—in scale, skill requirements, and technology—historians traditionally have analyzed them separately. ❸However, the workforces of all three were drawn primarily from the same population: young, mostly rural women aged 10 to 25. ❹Noting this commonality, Hunter argues that a consideration of the three branches of production together is long overdue: examining elements common to the different branches of textile production may, she asserts, permit the identification of gender-based factors that may have influenced the operation of the Japanese female labor market as a whole.</p>
